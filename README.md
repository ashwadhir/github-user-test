## Summary
This web application was auto-generated by an LLM based on the following brief:
> Publish a Bootstrap page with form id="github-user-12345" that fetches a GitHub username, optionally uses ?token=, and displays the account creation date in YYYY-MM-DD UTC inside #github-created-at, and the account age in whole years inside #github-account-age. It also provides an `aria-live` alert (`#github-status`) to report lookup status (start, success, failure) for accessibility.
